      <h1>Technology</h1>
      <p>Autonomous cars use a variety of techniques to detect their surroundings, such as radar, laser light, GPS, odometry and computer vision.</p>
      <p>Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify decent navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant traffic signs.</p>
      <p>Autonomous cars must have control systems that are capable of analyzing sensory data to distinguish between different cars on the road.</p>
      <p>Modern self-driving cars generally use Bayesian Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms, which fuse data from multiple sensors
      <p>and an off-line map into current location estimatess and map updates.</p>
      <p>SLAM with detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), which also handles things such as cars and pedestrians, is a variant being developed at Google.</p>
      <p>Simpler systems may use roadside real-time locating system (RTLS) beacon systems to aid localisation.</p>
      <p>Typical sensors include stereo vision, GPS and IMU. Visual object recognition uses machine vision including neural networks.</p>
