        <h2>Advanced Sensor Coverage</h2>
        <p>All of Tesla's product are equiped with their self-driving hardware.</p>
        <p>Eight surround cameras provide 360 degrees of visibility around the car</p>
        <p>at up to 250 meters of range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement</p>
        <p>this vision, allowing for detection of both hard and soft objects. A forward-facing radar with enhanced</p>
        <p>processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength</p>
        <p>that is able to see through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead. With this system the car is able to predict</p>
        <p>any dangerous situation incoming before the driver can even see what is going on.</p>

        <h2>Join and leave a freeway</h2>
        <p>Once on the freeway, the Tesla will determine which lane you need to be in and when. In addition to ensuring you reach your intended exit,</p>
        <p>Autopilot will watch for opportunities to move to a faster lane when you're caught behind slower traffic. When you reach your exit,</p>
        <p> your Tesla will depart the freeway, slow down and transition control back to you.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Depart from home</h2>
        <p>All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go. If you donâ€™t say anything, your car will look at your calendar and take you</p>
        <p>there as the assumed destination. Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route, navigating urban streets, complex intersections and freeways.</p>
