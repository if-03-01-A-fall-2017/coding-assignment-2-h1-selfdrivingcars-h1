        <h2>What Are Autonomous Cars?</h2>
        <p>A car which can navigate, scan its surrounding and drive without any human input is called an autonomous car, also known as driverless, self-driving or robotic car.</p>
        <p>In 2017 no cars had a permission to drive on public roads without a human behind the wheel who always has to be able to take control over the car.</p>
